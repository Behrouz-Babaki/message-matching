Each event is similar to what an individual's app would notice.
So `human_id` is the app owner (`Human`)'s unique id.
`time` is the start of the event.
'payload' is the information about the event.


Following events are reported -
1. `encounter` - When two `Human`s are present at the same `Location` at the same time, this event is recorded for both the `Human`s.

```
{
 "human_id": 999,

 "event_type": "encounter",
 "payload": {
  "encounter_human_id": 921,
  "duration": 9.0, # seconds
  "distance": 506, # centimeters
  "lat": 181, # x-coordinate
  "lon": 650  # y-coordinate
 }
}
```
2. `symptom_start` - When a symptom shows up an event is recorded. It can be COVID or non-COVID symptoms.
